## 🧠 About the Project

This repository contains the work I completed during my first-year university course in Interactive Arts and Science.  
The course focused on the **basics of web development**, introducing:
- HTML structure and semantics
- CSS styling and layout techniques
- Embedding images, links, and simple media

It was my first exposure to frontend development and sparked my interest in building for the web.


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for building the content structure
- **CSS3** – for layout and design
- (No JavaScript was used in this project)

## 📚 What I Learned

- Structuring web pages with semantic HTML
- Styling with CSS classes and IDs
- Linking between pages and embedding images
- Using folders to organize a web project
