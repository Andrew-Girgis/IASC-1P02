		<p>A websites skeleton is <em>HTML</em>. HTML is the language of the web, Everything you see on the web uses some HTML to provide content and structure. HTML is made up of many parts. Firstly, DOCTYPE is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. Secondly the <em>head</em>, in the head you can find the meta and title. The head is not seen in the webpage but its an extremely important part of any webpage. Next important part of html is the <em>meta</em>, meta goes in the head of the code its important because it tells the web browser what ur website is about, for example if you want to create a website about ur coffee shop you could put coffee shop in the description. Finally the <em>body</em>, the body is the content that the visiter of the website will see when he opens ur webpage, like this content. There are many tags you can use in the body, such as 'p' to make a paragraph, 'img' to link an absolute or relative pictures or 'ul' to make an unordered list. Throughout this webpage you will see examples of all the tags that were mentioned and more. </p>
